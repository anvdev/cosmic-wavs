# Submission and Aggregator Configuration

Defines how to submit workflow results to an EVM chain via an aggregator service and how to implement submission contracts.

1. **Submit Definition in service.json**

- Use the `submit` field to specify submission logic.
- For aggregator submission:

```json
"submit": {
    "aggregator": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8001"
    }
},
"aggregators": [
    {
        "evm": {
            "chain_name": "local",
            "address": "0xd6f8ff0036d8b2088107902102f9415330868109",
            "max_gas": 5000000
        }
    }
]
```

- Set `"submit": "none"` if no submission is needed; results will not be sent on-chain.

2. **Submission Contract Requirements**

- Must implement `handleSignedEnvelope()` from the `IWavsServiceHandler` interface.
- Use `IWavsServiceManager` to validate data and signatures.
- The contract validates operator signatures and processes component output.
- The `DataWithId` struct must match the component output format.

3. **Example Submission Contract**

```solidity
import {IWavsServiceManager} from "@wavs/interfaces/IWavsServiceManager.sol";
import {IWavsServiceHandler} from "@wavs/interfaces/IWavsServiceHandler.sol";
import {ITypes} from "interfaces/ITypes.sol";

contract SimpleSubmit is ITypes, IWavsServiceHandler {
    IWavsServiceManager private _serviceManager;

    constructor(IWavsServiceManager serviceManager) {
        _serviceManager = serviceManager;
    }

    function handleSignedEnvelope(Envelope calldata envelope, SignatureData calldata signatureData) external {
        _serviceManager.validate(envelope, signatureData);
        DataWithId memory dataWithId = abi.decode(envelope.payload, (DataWithId));
        // Custom data processing logic here
    }
}
```

4. **Aggregator Overview**

- Collects signed responses from multiple operators.
- Validates each operator's signature.
- Aggregates signatures once a threshold is met (exact match consensus).
- Submits aggregated data to the submission contract.
- Currently supports ECDSA signatures; BLS support planned.

5. **Aggregator Submission Flow**

1. Operator runs component → returns `WasmResponse` with `payload` and optional `ordering`.
2. Operator creates and signs an Envelope with result data.
3. Packet (envelope + signature + route info) sent to aggregator `/packet` endpoint.
4. Aggregator validates signature and queues packets by trigger event and service ID.
5. When threshold met:
   - Combine signatures into one `SignatureData`.
   - Validate combined signatures on-chain via service manager.
6. If valid, aggregator calls `handleSignedEnvelope()` on submit contract with signatures and payload.
7. Submit contract validates data and signatures via service manager.

6. **Chaining Workflows**

- Workflows can be chained by triggering one workflow on the submission event of another.
- See the [Workflows page](./workflows) for details.
