<Callout title="Before proceeding" type="warn">

{/* This section is also in [](./2-setup.mdx). Remember to update there as well */}

1. Make sure that Docker is installed. If you are using Docker Desktop, make sure it is open and running. If you are using Mac OS, make sure that your[ Docker app is configured correctly](./2-setup#docker).

2. Make sure that you have already run the following commands from the [system setup section](./2-setup#cargo-components).

```bash docci-ignore
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-component wasm-tools warg-cli wkg --locked --no-confirm --force

# Configure default registry
wkg config --default-registry wa.dev

# Allow publishing to a registry
warg key new
```


</Callout>

## Build components

Run the following command in your terminal to build your component. Exclude `WASI_BUILD_DIR` to build all components.

```bash docci-if-file-not-exists="./compiled/evm_price_oracle.wasm"
WASI_BUILD_DIR=components/evm-price-oracle make wasi-build
```

This command will build any components present in the `/components` directory, as well as auto-generate bindings and compile the components to WASM. The output will be placed in the `compiled` directory.

<Callout title="Build command" type="info">
You can also use the command below to build your solidity contracts and components in one command:


```bash docci-if-file-not-exists="./compiled/evm_price_oracle.wasm"
make build
```

</Callout>

## Testing and debugging

You can use the following command to execute the component using Cast. This command is handy for testing components without having to deploy WAVS.

An ID of 1 is Bitcoin. Nothing will be saved on-chain, just the output of the component is shown.


```bash
make wasi-exec
```

This command runs your component locally in a simulated environment and lets you easily view `print` statements for debugging. Running this command in the oracle example will print the information from the oracle [component code](./4-component). Visit the [component walkthrough](../handbook/components/component#logging-in-a-component) for more information on logging during testing and production.


Upon successful execution, you should receive a result similar to the following:

```bash docci-ignore
resp_data: Ok(PriceFeedData { symbol: "BTC", timestamp: "2025-02-14T01:23:03.963Z", price: 96761.74120116462 })
 INFO Fuel used:
1477653

Result (hex encoded):
7b2273796d626f6c223a22425443222c2274696d657374616d70223a22323032352d30322d31345430313a32333a30332e3936335a222c227072696365223a39363736312e37343132303131363436327d

Result (utf8):
{"symbol":"BTC","timestamp":"2025-02-14T01:23:03.963Z","price":96761.74120116462}
```

<Callout title="Fuel" type="info">

In the output above, the `INFO Fuel used` value represents the computational power consumed during execution. Similar to how on-chain transactions have a gas limit to cap transaction costs, WAVS enforces a fuel limit to control off-chain computational workload and protect against DoS attacks.

The maximum fuel allocation can be adjusted in the `Makefile` to accommodate different processing needs.
