1. After setting up your environment, open a terminal and run the following command to create your WAVS Foundry Template project. In this example, your project will be called `my-wavs`.

```bash docci-ignore
forge init --template Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template my-wavs --branch main
```

2. Then, enter your project:

```bash docci-ignore
cd my-wavs
```

3. Run the following command to open your project in VS code, or open it in the editor of your choice:

```bash docci-ignore
code .
```

## Explore the template

This template repo contains all the files you'll need to build, run, and test WAVS services locally.

The template already contains the necessary files for the oracle example to run. For example, the trigger ([`WavsTrigger.sol`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/main/src/contracts/WavsTrigger.sol)) and submission ([`WavsSubmit.sol`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/main/src/contracts/WavsSubmit.sol)) contracts can be found in the [`/my-wavs/src/contracts`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/main/src) folder.

In [`/evm-price-oracle/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/main/components/evm-price-oracle/src/lib.rs) you'll find the oracle service component.

This template uses a [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/main/Makefile) and environment variables to help with your developer experience. If you are ever curious about one of the `Make` commands in the following sections, you can always look at the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/main/Makefile) to learn more.

<Callout title="Info" type="info">

You can run the following command from the root of the repo to see all of the commands and environment variable overrides available:

```bash docci-ignore
make help
```

</Callout>

The next sections will show you how to deploy your contracts and components, set up WAVS, and run the oracle example.


## Build and test your contracts

Run the following commands from the root of your project to install necessary dependencies, build the template contracts, and run tests using Forge.

```bash
# Install dependencies
make setup

# Build the contracts
forge build

# Run the solidity tests.
forge test
```

The last command runs a basic unit test which verifies that the `SimpleTrigger` contract in `/WavsTrigger.sol` correctly stores and retrieves trigger data.
