# WAVSai - Next Steps and Context

## Current Status

We've built the WAVSai system, which consists of the following components:

1. **WAVSai.md**: System architecture document outlining structure, validation frameworks, and success metrics
2. **WAVSai-claude.md**: Knowledge base for Claude with templates, error patterns, and validation checklists
3. **WAVSai-process.md**: Process flowchart guiding component creation step-by-step
4. **WAVSai-example-ens.md**: Working example of an ENS resolver component
5. **WAVSai-summary.md**: Executive summary of the system
6. **rules.md**: Concise reference guide for creating WAVS components

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. System Integration (Claude Code Integration)

- [ ] Create a plugin or extension for Claude Code that automatically loads the WAVSai system
- [ ] Develop detection mechanism to recognize when users request WAVS components
- [ ] Implement automatic WAVSai process triggering when component requests are detected
- [ ] Create standardized Claude prompts that incorporate WAVSai knowledge

### 2. Knowledge Base Expansion

- [ ] Add templates for at least 5 more common component types:
  - [ ] Price oracle components
  - [ ] Token balance checkers
  - [ ] ENS/domain resolution
  - [ ] Gas price estimators
  - [ ] Weather data components
- [ ] Document more API integrations with authentication patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive error database with solutions
- [ ] Develop specialized validation routines for each component type

### 3. Tooling Development

- [ ] Create a pre-validation CLI tool that checks component code before building
- [ ] Develop automated test case generator for components
- [ ] Build a component template generator based on requirements
- [ ] Create visualization tools for component data flow

### 4. Documentation and Training

- [ ] Create user documentation explaining WAVSai capabilities and usage
- [ ] Develop tutorial videos demonstrating the system
- [ ] Create case studies showing before/after development time
- [ ] Provide sample prompts for requesting different component types

### 5. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Run user testing sessions with different component requests
- [ ] Track success rate metrics
- [ ] Identify common failure patterns
- [ ] Implement feedback loop to improve the system

### 6. Deployment Strategy

- [ ] Integrate with existing Claude Code deployment
- [ ] Create onboarding process for new users
- [ ] Develop marketing materials highlighting benefits
- [ ] Set up analytics to track usage and success rates

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Start with System Integration:
   - Design plugin/extension architecture
   - Create detection patterns for component requests
   - Develop standardized prompts

2. Begin Knowledge Base Expansion:
   - Create template for a price oracle component
   - Document Ethereum RPC integration patterns
   - Develop validation routine for price oracle components

3. Initial Tooling:
   - Create simple pre-validation script
   - Develop component template generator prototype

## Notes on Current System

- WAVSai is designed as a comprehensive system to enable error-free WAVS component creation
- The system uses validation-first approach to prevent errors before they occur
- Current examples focus on ENS resolution but can be expanded to other component types
- The system handles common issues like ABI decoding, type conversions, and memory management
- We've identified key error patterns and developed solutions for them

## Component Development Process

The WAVSai process follows these steps:
1. Understand requirements
2. Research phase for APIs/services
3. Plan component design
4. Pre-validate design against error patterns
5. Implement the component
6. Final validation checks
7. Deliver with clear user instructions

This document serves as a roadmap for implementing and expanding the WAVSai system to achieve the goal of error-free WAVS component creation on the first try.
