## Start Anvil, WAVS, and Deploy Eigenlayer

1. Create a `.env` file for your project by copying over the example with the following command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Use the following command to start an Anvil test chain and the WAVS runtime while deploying core EigenLayer contracts for your service:

```bash docci-background docci-delay-after=15
make start-all
```

<Callout title="Keep WAVS running" type="info">

The `start-all` command must remain running in your terminal. Open another terminal to run other commands.

You can stop the services with `ctrl+c`. Some MacOS terminals require pressing this twice.

</Callout>


With the chain and WAVS running, you can deploy and run your service.

## Local Testnet Values

```bash docci-delay-after=2
export SERVICE_MANAGER_ADDRESS=$(jq -r .addresses.WavsServiceManager .nodes/avs_deploy.json)
export PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat .nodes/deployer)
export MY_ADDR=$(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY)
```

## Deploy solidity contracts

Open a new terminal and run the following from the root of your project to upload your Service's Trigger and Submission contracts:

```bash docci-delay-per-cmd=2
forge create SimpleSubmit --json --broadcast -r http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key "${PRIVATE_KEY}" --constructor-args "${SERVICE_MANAGER_ADDRESS}" > .docker/submit.json
export SERVICE_SUBMISSION_ADDR=`jq -r .deployedTo .docker/submit.json`

forge create SimpleTrigger --json --broadcast -r http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key "${PRIVATE_KEY}" > .docker/trigger.json
export SERVICE_TRIGGER_ADDR=`jq -r .deployedTo .docker/trigger.json`
```

## Deploy your service to WAVS

The following command will deploy your WASI component and service information to WAVS to be run by operators when triggered:

```bash docci-ignore (run in the next codeblock)
SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9999/service.json make deploy-service
```

This command specifies the event emitted from your trigger contract as the on-chain event that will trigger your service. In the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/Makefile#L95-L102), you can also see that it specifies the submission contract as the `submit-address`, as well as the filename of your component.

<Callout title="Customize variables" type="info">

Open the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/Makefile#L9-L22) to view the different variables that you can customize, including the trigger event, the component filename, and the service config.

You can also modify variables by specifying them before running the `make` command:

```bash docci-delay-per-cmd=2
# Build your service JSON
export COMPONENT_FILENAME=evm_price_oracle.wasm
AGGREGATOR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001 sh ./script/build_service.sh

# Deploy the service JSON
SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9999/service.json make deploy-service
```

</Callout>


## Trigger the Service

Next, use your deployed trigger contract to trigger the oracle to be run. In the following command, you'll specify the `COIN_MARKET_CAP_ID` as `1`, which corresponds to the ID of Bitcoin.

Running this command will execute [`/script/Trigger.s.sol`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/script/Trigger.s.sol) and pass the ID to the trigger contract, starting the following chain of events:

1. The trigger contract will emit an event with the specified ID as its data.
2. Operators listening for the event will receive the data and run it in the oracle component off-chain.
3. The oracle component will use the ID to query the price of Bitcoin from the CoinMarketCap API.
4. The returned data will be signed by operators and passed to the submission contract, which will verify the operator's signature and submit the price of Bitcoin on-chain 🎉


```bash docci-delay-per-cmd=2
export COIN_MARKET_CAP_ID=1
export SERVICE_TRIGGER_ADDR=`make get-trigger-from-deploy`
forge script ./script/Trigger.s.sol ${SERVICE_TRIGGER_ADDR} ${COIN_MARKET_CAP_ID} --sig 'run(string,string)' --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

## Show the result

Run the following to view the result of your service in your terminal:

```bash docci-delay-per-cmd=2 docci-output-contains="BTC"
# Get the latest TriggerId and show the result via `script/ShowResult.s.sol`
make show-result
```

Congratulations, you've just made a simple Bitcoin price oracle service using WAVS!
