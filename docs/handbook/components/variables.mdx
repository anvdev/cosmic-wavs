Components can be configured with two types of variables:

## Public variables

These variables can be used for non-sensitive information that can be viewed publicly. These variables are set in the `config` field of a service manifest. All config values are stored as strings, even for numbers.

To add public variables:

1. Add the public variables to the `config` field in the service manifest:

```json
"component": {
    "config": {
        "api_endpoint": "https://api.example.com",  // accessible via host::config_var()
        "max_retries": "3"  // Config values are always strings
    }
}
```

2. Access them in the component using `host::config_var()`:

```rust
let value = host::config_var("api_endpoint");
```

## Environment keys

Environment keys are private and can be used for sensitive data like API keys. These variables are set by operators in their environment and are not viewable by anyone. These variables must be prefixed with `WAVS_ENV_`. Each operator must set these variables in their environment before deploying the service. WAVS validates that all environment variables are set before allowing the service to run.

To add private variables:

1. Create a new `.env` file in WAVS template:

```bash
# copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

Variables can also be set in your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` files.

2. Set the environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
# .env file
WAVS_ENV_MY_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

3. Access the environment key from a component:

```rust
let api_key = std::env::var("WAVS_ENV_MY_API_KEY")?;
```

4. Before deploying a service, add the environment key to the `env_keys` array in the service manifest:

```json
"component": {
    "env_keys": [
        "WAVS_ENV_API_KEY"  // Environment variables the component can access. Must be prefixed with WAVS_ENV_
    ]
}
```

## Local Execution

When running components locally (raw), use the `--config` flag to set values in a KEY=VALUE format, comma-separated: `--config a=1,b=2`.

```bash
wavs-cli exec --component <COMPONENT> --input <INPUT> --config api_endpoint=https://api.example.com
```
