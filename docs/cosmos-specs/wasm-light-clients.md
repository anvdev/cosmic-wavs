Designing a custom light client for a Cosmos-SDK network that integrates with a set of operators using BLS12-381 signatures for consensus on specific data, while adhering to the IBC WebAssembly (Wasm) light client standard, involves several key considerations. 

## Goals
- minimize trust of AVS operator sets

### Requirements 
- Update client state 
- Update expected bls signatures for opereator set
- Verification via bs12-381 signature
 
### 1. **Understanding the Requirements**
- **Objective**: 
 

### 2. **Core Components of the Light Client**
To build this light client, we need to define its architecture, focusing on the following components:

#### a. **Data Structure for Consensus**
- **Data to Verify**: The operators reach consensus on a specific piece of data (e.g., a state root, transaction set, or custom payload). This data is hashed (e.g., using SHA-256) to produce a `data_hash`.
  - verifiable ethereum header or data
  - verifiable hash of cosmos chain
  - any hash of actions WAVS is expecct

- **BLS12-381 Signatures**: Each operator signs the `data_hash` using their BLS12-381 private key. BLS12-381 allows aggregating multiple signatures into a single signature, reducing verification overhead.
- **Block Header**: The light client tracks block headers, which include:
  - A `header_hash` (hash of the block header).
  - The `data_hash` (the data agreed upon by operators).
  - An aggregated BLS12-381 signature from the operators.
  - A timestamp and block height for ordering and finality.
  - A reference to the operator set (e.g., their public keys or a commitment like a Merkle root).

#### b. **Operator Set Management**
- **Operator Set**: A predefined set of operators, each with a BLS12-381 public/private key pair.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The operator set may change over time (e.g., due to staking or governance). The light client must:
  - Store the initial operator set (public keys or a commitment).
  - Support updates via a governance-approved mechanism, included in the block header or a separate message.
- **Threshold**: Define a signature threshold (e.g., 2/3 of operators) for consensus, ensuring security against malicious operators.

#### c. **IBC Wasm Light Client Interface**
The IBC Wasm light client standard (ICS-08) requires implementing specific methods in WebAssembly. Key methods include:
- **Initialize**: Set up the light client with the initial operator set, genesis block header, and trust parameters.
- **VerifyMembership**: Verify that a piece of data is included in the `data_hash` signed by operators.
- **VerifyNonMembership**: Prove that certain data is not included (if applicable).
- **UpdateClient**: Process new block headers, verify the aggregated BLS signature, and update the client’s state.
- **CheckHeaderAndUpdateState**: Validate the new header’s `header_hash`, `data_hash`, and BLS signature against the operator set.

### 3. **BLS12-381 Signature Integration**
BLS12-381 signatures are ideal for this use case due to their aggregation properties, which reduce verification costs. Here’s how they fit in:
- **Signing Process**:
  - Each operator signs the `data_hash` using their BLS12-381 private key.
  - Signatures are aggregated into a single signature using BLS12-381’s aggregation algorithm.
  - The aggregated signature and `data_hash` are included in the block header.
- **Verification**:
  - The light client verifies the aggregated signature against the operator set’s public keys using BLS12-381’s verification algorithm.
  - If the signature is valid and meets the threshold (e.g., 2/3 of operators), the `data_hash` is trusted.
- **Efficiency**:
  - BLS12-381 reduces the signature size to a single 48-byte signature (in G1) regardless of the number of signers.
  - Pairing-based verification ensures the client only performs one pairing operation for the aggregated signature.

### 4. **Light Client Workflow**
<!-- Here’s how the light client operates:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the genesis block header, including the initial `data_hash`, aggregated BLS signature, and operator set (public keys or commitment).
   - Set trust parameters (e.g., trusting period, signature threshold).
2. **Header Validation**:
   - Receive a new block header containing:
     - `header_hash`
     - `data_hash`
     - Aggregated BLS signature
     - Block height and timestamp
   - Verify the aggregated BLS signature against the operator set’s public keys.
   - Check that the block height is incremental and the timestamp is within the trusting period.
3. **State Update**:
   - If the header is valid, update the light client’s state with the new `header_hash`, `data_hash`, and block height.
   - Store the operator set update (if included in the header).
4. **IBC Operations**:
   - For `VerifyMembership`, check if a specific data item is included in the `data_hash` (e.g., via Merkle proof if the data is structured as a Merkle tree).
   - For `UpdateClient`, process new headers and ensure continuity (e.g., check parent hash or block height). -->

### 5. **Conforming to IBC Wasm Standard**
<!-- - **Header Format**: Define a custom header format that includes:
- `header_hash`: SHA-256 hash of the header.
- `data_hash`: Hash of the consensus data.
- `agg_signature`: Aggregated BLS12-381 signature.
- `operator_set_commitment`: Merkle root or list of public keys.
- `height` and `timestamp`. -->

### 6. **Security Considerations**
- **Operator Set Security**:
  - Ensure the operator set is trusted (e.g., selected via staking or governance).
  - Implement mechanisms to detect and handle operator set updates securely (e.g., signed by the current set).
- **Signature Threshold**: Use a threshold (e.g., 2/3) to prevent a minority of malicious operators from compromising the system.
- **Fork Resistance**: Verify block continuity (e.g., parent hash or height) to prevent accepting headers from a forked chain.
- **Trusting Period**: Enforce a trusting period to limit the window for attacks, aligned with IBC’s security model.
- **BLS12-381 Security**: Ensure the implementation uses a secure BLS12-381 library and follows best practices (e.g., avoiding rogue key attacks by requiring proof of possession).

### 7. **Implementation Steps**
1. **Choose a Language and Libraries**:
   - Use Rust for Wasm compatibility and performance.
   - Leverage `bls12_381` or `ark-bls12-381` for BLS signature operations.
   - Use `cosmos-sdk` and `ibc-rs` for IBC integration.
2. **Define Data Structures**:
   - Block header: `{ header_hash, data_hash, agg_signature, height, timestamp, operator_set_commitment }`.
   - Client state: `{ latest_header, operator_set, trusting_period, threshold }`.
3. **Implement IBC Methods**:
   - `initialize`: Set up genesis state.
   - `check_header_and_update_state`: Verify BLS signature and update state.
   - `verify_membership`: Validate data inclusion in `data_hash`.
4. **Test BLS Signature Aggregation**:
   - Simulate operators signing a `data_hash` and aggregating signatures.
   - Verify the aggregated signature on the client side.
5. **Integrate with Cosmos-SDK**:
   - Compile the client to Wasm.
   - Test with a Cosmos-SDK testnet supporting IBC Wasm (e.g., using `wasmd`).
6. **Optimize for Gas**:
   - Minimize storage and computation (e.g., use compact BLS signatures, avoid redundant checks).
   - Benchmark verification costs in Wasm.

### 8. **Challenges and Mitigations**
- **Challenge**: Operator set updates can introduce complexity and security risks.
  - **Mitigation**: Require updates to be signed by the current operator set and validated within the trusting period.
- **Challenge**: BLS12-381 verification is computationally intensive.
  - **Mitigation**: Use aggregation to minimize verification costs and optimize Wasm code for gas efficiency.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring IBC compatibility across chains.
  - **Mitigation**: Strictly adhere to ICS-08 interfaces and test with multiple Cosmos-SDK chains.
