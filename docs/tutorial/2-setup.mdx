The following installations are required to run this example. Follow the steps below to set up your system.

<Callout title="System recommendations" type="info">

This tutorial is designed for Windows WSL, Linux, and macOS systems.

</Callout>

## Environment

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) if you don't already have them.

## Rust

Run the following command to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).


```bash docci-ignore
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

<Callout title="Homebrew Rust not supported" type="error">

If you installed Rust using Homebrew, you will need to uninstall it and install it again using the rustup command.

```bash docci-ignore
brew uninstall rust
```
Then run:
```bash docci-ignore
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
</Callout>

<Callout title="Fresh Install" type="info">

If you just installed Rust for the first time, you will need to run the following commands:

```bash docci-ignore
# Install required target and toolchain
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```
</Callout>


<Callout title="Upgrade Rust" type="info">

If you already have a previous version of Rust installed, you will need to run the following commands to upgrade it to the latest stable version:

```bash docci-ignore
# Remove old targets if present
rustup target remove wasm32-wasi || true
rustup target remove wasm32-wasip1 || true

# Update and add required target
rustup update stable
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```
</Callout>


## Cargo components

Install the following for building WebAssembly components. Visit the [Cargo Component documentation](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component#installation) for more information.

{/* This section is also in [](./5-build.mdx). Remember to update there as well */}
```bash docci-ignore
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-component wasm-tools warg-cli wkg --locked --no-confirm --force

# Configure default registry
# Found at: $HOME/.config/wasm-pkg/config.toml
wkg config --default-registry wa.dev

# Allow publishing to a registry
warg key new
```

<Callout title="WSL Ubuntu GLIB out of date" type="error">

If you are on Ubuntu LTS but encounter an error like `wkg: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.38' not found (required by wkg)`:

```bash
sudo do-release-upgrade
```
</Callout>

## Foundry

[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is a solidity development suite. The Foundry toolchain contains Anvil (a local testnet node), Forge (build and test smart contracts), Cast (an RPC call CLI), and Chisel (a Solidity REPL).


1. Install Foundryup, the official Foundry installer.

```bash docci-ignore
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

2. Install Foundry

```bash docci-ignore
foundryup
```

## Docker

Visit the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) for more info.

  <Tab value="MacOS">
    ```bash docci-ignore
    brew install --cask docker
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Linux">

  The following commands will install Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

    ```bash docci-ignore
    # Install Docker
    sudo apt -y install docker.io
    # Install Docker Compose
    sudo apt-get install docker-compose-v2
    ```
  </Tab>

<Callout title="Docker for MacOS" type="warn">

{/* This section is also in [](./5-build.mdx). Remember to update there as well */}

If prompted, remove container with `sudo apt remove containerd.io`

If you are using Docker Desktop, make sure it is open and running for this tutorial.

Before proceeding, make sure that the following setting is updated:

**Enable Host Networking**: Open Docker and navigate to -> Settings -> Resources -> Network. Make sure that 'Enable Host Networking' is turned on.

Alternatively, you can install the following:

```bash docci-ignore
brew install chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect && sudo brew services start chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect
```

If you are running on a Mac with an ARM chip, you will need to do the following:

- Set up Rosetta:

```bash docci-ignore
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

- Enable Rosetta (Docker Desktop: Settings -> General -> enable "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon")

</Callout>

## Node.js

Node v21+ is needed for the WAVS template. Visit the [NVM Installation guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to install Node Version Manager and update your Node version.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
```

After setting up your system, continue to the next page to create your project.
